# sockets-elm

Playing with the capabilities of Elm/Crystal. 
Currently rather jazzed about these two languages 
and decided to kickstart and play with something small. 

The [tutorial mentioned][1] mentioned assums the most basic knowledge of both technologies. 

All development was done with Docker containers. Namely:

1. Generating a [create-elm-app][2] using the [a wonderfully documented elm image][3]
1. Generating a crystal app and using shards with [the official crystal image][4]
